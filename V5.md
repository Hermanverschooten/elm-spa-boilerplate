# Is the future of Front-end development without HTML, CSS and Javascript?

Before [Artificial Intelligence  is taking over our Front-end jobs](https://blog.floydhub.com/turning-design-mockups-into-code-with-deep-learning/) let's think some way to make our life less miserables.

HTML, CSS and Javascript are old and they are carrying many bad things from the past.

Javascript has dedicated books about the good and the [bad](http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html) and [awful](http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/awful-parts.html) parts.

How can I prove this to you in an irrefutable way? Heasy, with the most reliable source of true, Internet memes.

Now that we settle this, let's see what we can do about it.

Around [1990](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) we started with HTML. In [1995](https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html) we invented Javascript ([in 10 days](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007-abs.html)) and in [1996](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-CSS1-19990111) we created CSS to separate presentation and content.

Then we decided that to keep them separated. HTML in a file, CSS in another and [Javascript in a third file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript). So we separated content, presentation and behavior.

The world was still too complicated so we added some syntactic sugar created stuff that (trans)compiles into them, like  [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [other several dozens](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js) and build [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to glue all browser together.

Then we decided to bring them all together [inside Javascript](https://reactjs.org/) so instead of having three bad things all over the places we could just have these three bad thing all together and the epic Frameworks affair started.

Let's take a break and see an example in React:

Let's build an input field that would modify a text in, something like (in Pug)

https://codepen.io/lucamug/pen/baXdpv

```Html
<div style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 10px;">
  <input value="test" oninput="document.getElementById('typed').innerHTML = this.value"/>
  <p>You typed: <span id="typed">test</span></p>
</div>
```

Cool! We just build an useless app.

https://codepen.io/lucamug/pen/dJxyEw?editors=0010

```Javascript
var Test = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
        return { typed: "test" };
    },
    render: function() {
        return (
            <div style={ { backgroundColor: "lightgray", padding: "10px" } } >
            <input
                value={this.state.typed}
                onChange={function(event) {this.setState({ typed: event.target.value });}.bind(this)}
            />
            <p>You typed: {this.state.typed}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
});
React.render(<Test />, document.body);
```

Without the  [JSX syntactic sugar](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html), this is what we get:

```Javascript
var Test = React.createClass({
    displayName: "Test",
    getInitialState: function getInitialState() {
        return { typed: "test" };
    },
    render: function render() {
        return React.createElement(
            "div",
            { style: { backgroundColor: "lightgray", padding: "10px" } },
            React.createElement("input", {
                value: this.state.typed,
                onChange: function (event) {
                    this.setState({ typed: event.target.value });
                }.bind(this)
            }),
            React.createElement(
                "p",
                null,
                "You typed: ",
                this.state.typed
            )
        );
    }
});
React.render(React.createElement(Test, null), document.body);
```

Is this all we got since 1990? Can we hope for a better future?

I think this is the best we can get if we want to stay in Javascript. Let's try to push further moving instead out of it completely.

The analogue in Elm

https://ellie-app.com/8hxmWCYHza1/1

```Elm
module Main exposing (..)

import Color exposing (..)
import Element exposing (..)
import Element.Background as Background
import Element.Input as Input
import Html exposing (beginnerProgram)

main : Program Never String Msg
main =
    beginnerProgram
        { model = "test"
        , view =
            \model ->
                layout [] <|
                    column [ Background.color lightGray ]
                        [ Input.text []
                            { onChange = Just NewContent
                            , text = model
                            , placeholder = Nothing
                            , label = Input.labelLeft [] <| text "Label"
                            , notice = Nothing
                            }
                        , el [] <| text model
                        ]
        , update =
            \msg model ->
                case msg of
                    NewContent typed ->
                        typed
        }

type Msg
    = NewContent String
```

It seems that we took some distance from HTML, CSS and Javascript) now. Was this the main purpose?

Yes, but only if we cold get something better in exchange.

With Elm you get also things like No-runtime-exceptions-in-practice™, If-it-compiles-it-works™, [etc](http://elm-lang.org/).

You also get opinionated tools. For example the author of the new version of [style-elements](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/stylish-elephants/4.0.0) used in the example above is considering removing the [<select> element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) due to its lack of [usability](https://medium.com/@kollinz/dropdown-alternatives-for-better-mobile-forms-53e40d641b53) it doesn't help to make good Interfaces.

Is this the right trend?
